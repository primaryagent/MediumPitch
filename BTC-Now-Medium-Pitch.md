# BTC Now - Business Summary

**Bitcoin installment plans with zero liquidation risk.** We're building the first securitized Bitcoin credit product—paying institutional investors fixed interest while giving consumers access to leverage without margin calls. 10-year terms at installment purchase pricing equivalent to 15% effective APR—no forced liquidations, ever.

---

## What We Do

We offer Bitcoin installment plans with installment purchase pricing equivalent to 15% effective APR over 10-year terms and zero margin call risk. Borrowers own their Bitcoin from day one, held in institutional custody (Coinbase/Anchorage) with transfer restrictions until final payment. Monthly payments remain fixed regardless of Bitcoin's price.

We package these loans into $100M tranches and securitize them as Bitcoin-Backed Securities (BBS)—AAA and BBB-rated bonds paying 7-9% coupons to institutional investors. This generates a $7.56M annual spread per tranche ($75.6M over 10 years), creating the first Bitcoin credit product that delivers fixed interest to bond investors.

Our bankruptcy-remote structure keeps Bitcoin off our balance sheet entirely, eliminating corporate risk.

**Current Stage:** Pre-revenue. Platform operational. April 27, 2026 live launch at Bitcoin Conference. Raising $7M at $40M post-money valuation.

## The Market

$2.2T Bitcoin market cap. $0 institutional credit access without liquidation risk.

**Credit gap:**
- Real estate: $55T value, $13T debt → 23% leverage
- Autos: $6T value, $1.5T debt → 25% leverage  
- Bitcoin: $2.2T value, $0 debt → 0% leverage

**Target market:**
- 40-50M Americans own cryptocurrency
- 36-45M crypto holders have FICO ≥ 670
- Average credit capacity: $30-50K per consumer
- Conservative 5% penetration at $40K average = $72-90B addressable

**Why existing credit fails:**

Existing credit options fail Bitcoin buyers for predictable reasons:

**Personal loans** prohibit investment use—covenant violations trigger immediate full repayment demands.

**HELOCs** require 20% home equity that young high-income earners ($100K-$175K salaries, FICO 720+) haven't yet accumulated.

**Credit cards** destroy credit scores at high utilization—carrying a $50K balance for 10 years tanks FICO by 100+ points.

**Margin loans** force liquidations during crashes—May 2021's 50% drop in 72 hours triggered mass liquidations at worst possible prices.

**Why 15% Effective APR:**

No comparable products exist with zero liquidation risk. Margin loans offer 8-12% rates but liquidate positions during crashes. Personal loans offer 10-18% rates but covenant restrictions prohibit investment use.

Installment purchase pricing equivalent to 15% effective APR reflects lender risk while providing the only non-liquidatable Bitcoin credit option in market. We are price makers, not price takers — zero competition exists for this structure.

> **Growth isn't capped by demand. Growth is capped by credit access.**

## The Moat

### Structural Advantages

**Bankruptcy-remote architecture:**

**Why banks cannot compete:**

Basel III banking regulations impose a **1250% risk weight** on Bitcoin exposures. This is the maximum possible risk weight under international banking rules.

What this means: For every $1 of Bitcoin-backed lending, regulated banks must hold **$1.25 in Tier 1 capital**. This makes direct Bitcoin lending economically impossible for banks.

**Real-world impact:**

A $100M Bitcoin-backed loan portfolio would require banks to hold $125M in regulatory capital—**more capital than the loan itself**. At typical bank ROE hurdles of 15%, they'd need $18.75M in annual profit just to justify holding the capital. Our installment pricing (15% effective APR) generates $15M annually on $100M—not enough to cover their cost of capital.

**Conclusion:** Banks cannot profitably offer this product under current regulations.

**BTC Now's structural advantage:**

Our warehouse is funded by private LPs, not bank deposits. This means:
- Zero Basel III capital requirements (we're not a bank)
- No regulatory capital charges on Bitcoin exposure
- Bitcoin held off-balance-sheet in bankruptcy-remote structure
- Institutional custody (Coinbase/Anchorage) provides security without bank-style capital requirements
- Higher capital velocity: Same $150M warehouse supports $1.2B in bond originations (12 tranches × $100M)

**This is a permanent regulatory moat.** Banks would need Basel III framework changes—requiring international coordination across 28 jurisdictions—to compete directly. The regulation was **strengthened** in 2023 (not loosened), and major revisions only happen every 3-5 years.

By the time regulatory change is possible (5-10 year timeline minimum), we'll have years of proprietary loan performance data and established market position.

**Self-healing warehouse:**

Unique to commodity-backed lending. Recovered Bitcoin reissued to new borrowers. Generates fresh origination fees without new capital. Reduces effective LGD vs. traditional consumer lending: 25-40% reduction from non-depreciating collateral alone, 50-70% when including all three layers (retained payments + collateral recovery at market value + reissuance economics).

Competitors cannot replicate without:
- Commodity-backed lending structure
- Institutional custody integration
- Operational reissuance systems
- Continuous underwriting capacity

**Capital efficiency at scale:**

Profitable at $100M originations. Banks need $500M-$1B to justify overhead (15-20% ROE hurdles).

Goldman Sachs rationally chooses to buy our bonds at 8% rather than build origination infrastructure for sub-$200M volumes. If we succeed, acquisition becomes the rational outcome.

### First-Mover Advantages

12-18 months proprietary loan performance data and rating agency relationships. Each loan adds to proprietary performance dataset competitors cannot replicate.

Competitors face 18-36 month structural delays:
- Regulatory approval (18-36 months for new crypto products at large banks)
- Technology infrastructure ($10-25M buildout, 12-24 months)
- Talent acquisition (12-24 months)

By time they launch, we have 12-18 months proprietary loan performance data, established rating agency relationships, proven bond placement track record.

### Crypto-Native Competitors

**Coinbase, Block, Gemini:**

Requires ALL pieces simultaneously—warehouse mechanics, securitization expertise, self-healing infrastructure. Their trading teams model installment plans as options, identify capital inefficiency. Massive warehouse capital earns better returns elsewhere.

Missing components:
- Securitization structuring expertise
- Warehouse facility economics
- Rating agency relationships (12-18 month lead time)
- Self-healing reissuance infrastructure

**If they enter:**

Better loan performance data. 12-18 month head start generating proprietary credit models, established rating agency relationships. Even with capital, need to acquire securitization expertise—build teams (12-24 months) or acquire platforms.

By time they assemble components, we compete on price compression, transparency, track record. First-mover data advantage compounds.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Launch Event

**Bitcoin Conference 2026 (April 27, Las Vegas)** — 50,000+ attendees, concentrated audience of high-intent Bitcoin buyers.

This provides ideal launch environment: concentrated target audience, high engagement, credibility from association with premier Bitcoin industry event.

### Viral Referral Program

Pay referrers amount equal to customer's first installment payment (one-time). Enables YouTube creators, X accounts, and influencers to monetize Bitcoin content while driving customer acquisition.

**Zero upfront marketing spend** — referral fees paid from collected revenue only.

**Referral examples (scales with loan size):**
- $50K Bitcoin purchase → ~$833 first payment → $833 referral
- $100K Bitcoin purchase → ~$1,667 first payment → $1,667 referral
- $200K Bitcoin purchase → ~$3,333 first payment → $3,333 referral

**Viral mechanics:** High-ticket items with referral payments that scale with transaction size create strong incentive for crypto influencers to promote product and drive larger purchases.

**Capital efficiency:** No upfront marketing burn. Customer acquisition costs are paid from revenue after first payment collected. Scales organically with transaction volume.

## How It Works

### For Borrowers

Bitcoin spot: $100,000

Installment price: $192,000 (includes service fee, 1.92x multiplier)

Monthly payment: $1,600 × 120 months

Effective APR: 15%

**Ownership & Custody:** Your Bitcoin is held in institutional custody under your name from day one, with transfer restrictions until final payment.

**Payment Structure:** Fixed monthly payments regardless of Bitcoin's price. No margin calls, ever. Prepay anytime without penalty.

**Liquidation Options (Borrower-Initiated Only):** Through the app, you can request partial liquidation at any time. This option is typically exercised when Bitcoin appreciates significantly and you want to capture gains—any excess Bitcoin after settling your balance is returned to you. In downturn scenarios, your payment obligations continue regardless of Bitcoin's price (no forced liquidations by lenders), but voluntary liquidation becomes less attractive. Warehouse and bond investors can NEVER force liquidation—it's your Bitcoin, you control the timing. No USD refunds; pay through completion for full Bitcoin transfer rights.

**Key differentiator from margin loans:** Margin loans force liquidation when LTV is breached. BTC Now: Only borrower can trigger liquidation, voluntary only. Zero forced liquidation risk.

52% collateral coverage: $100,000 Bitcoin backs $192,000 total obligation. 48% credit cushion from service fee. Unlike traditional lending where the unsecured portion represents total loss, this 48% spread provides genuine loss protection because Bitcoin can always be recovered at market value and reissued, generating fresh revenue without new capital.

### For Investors

$100M tranches structured as bonds:
- $70M AAA (7% coupon, monthly interest + principal)
- $20M BBB (9% coupon, monthly interest + principal)
- $10M equity (retained by warehouse)
- $10M reserve pool (funded from monthly payments, first-loss protection)

Weighted average coupon: 7.44% ($70M at 7% + $20M at 9% over $90M bonds). Annual spread: 7.56%.

Capital deployment: $12M per tranche ($10M equity retained in SPV + $2M issuance fee paid by warehouse). Reserve pool builds from payment waterfall, not upfront capital.

AAA protected by 40% subordination. Survives 70% lifetime defaults with AAA fully protected—because Bitcoin can always be recovered at market value (unlike depreciating auto/home collateral in traditional lending).

Payment waterfall: Servicing → AAA → BBB → Reserve → Equity.

Equity tranche receives monthly excess spread distributions. Returns flow to warehouse fund. Funds new loan originations. Capital recycles without external raises.

First securitized Bitcoin credit product—investors never hold Bitcoin, receive 7-9% fixed coupons from $2.2T credit market backed by bankruptcy-remote structure.

### Capital Efficiency

$150M warehouse → $1.2B bond origination capacity (12 tranches × $100M).

Each $100M bond requires $12M warehouse capital impact ($10M equity locked in SPV + $2M issuance fee paid to GP). During 60-90 day **pre-bond** loan seasoning in warehouse: borrowers pay 15% effective APR. Cash collected builds equity for bond issuance.

Post-bond: warehouse receives monthly excess spread. Funds new loan originations. Capital recycles without external fundraising.

**Cash flow cycle:**
1. Originate $100M loans with warehouse capital
2. Collect payments during seasoning (60-90 days)
3. Package loans into $100M bond structure
4. Sell $90M bonds to institutions ($70M AAA + $20M BBB)
5. Receive $90M cash proceeds, retain $10M equity tranche
6. Warehouse capital refreshed: $90M returned, $10M equity held
7. Originate next $100M loan batch immediately
8. Receive monthly excess spread from issued bonds
9. Repeat cycle

$150M warehouse supports 12 outstanding tranches as bonds ($12M capital impact each: $10M locked + $2M paid). Total: $120M in equity tranches locked + $24M in fees paid across 12 tranches. Bond sale proceeds + monthly spreads drive capital velocity.

Profitable at $100M originations. Banks need $500M-$1B to justify overhead.

**Scalability:** GP/LP warehouse structure enables rapid capital raises when demand scales. First LP model replicates for subsequent warehouse expansion.

**Self-healing mechanism:** Recovered Bitcoin from defaults reissued to new borrowers. Generate fresh origination fees without new capital. Reduces effective LGD vs. traditional consumer lending: 25-40% reduction from non-depreciating collateral alone, 50-70% when including all three layers (retained payments + collateral recovery at market value + reissuance economics).

Enables sustainable loan swap performance guarantee: Non-performing loans swapped out of bonds during 12-24 month seasoning period → if default, Bitcoin recovered → reissued as new performing loans → available for future bond collateral. Traditional lenders deplete capital with each swap. We recycle swapped defaults back into performing assets.

Traditional lenders liquidate repossessed collateral at loss, redeploy fresh capital. We retain Bitcoin, reissue it.

### Unit Economics & Default Assumptions

**Base case lifetime default rate:** 8-15% over 10-year bond life.

This assumes borrowers with FICO 670+ scores purchasing Bitcoin installments. Comparable to unsecured consumer loan performance for similar credit profiles.

**Stress test:** Structure survives 70% lifetime defaults with AAA tranche fully protected.

**Why we survive extreme stress:**

Bitcoin recovery and reissuance mechanism reduces effective Loss Given Default (LGD). Unlike traditional consumer lending where repossessed collateral depreciates 20-40%, Bitcoin can always be recovered at market value and reissued to new borrowers. This generates fresh origination fees ($1M per $100M reissued) and new 10-year payment streams without deploying new capital.

**Example:** $100M loan pool, 70% default over 10 years = $70M defaulted principal. Bitcoin backing: $36.4M (52% collateral coverage). Even with 50% Bitcoin price decline: $18.2M recovery value. Reissue as new installment plans → generates $35M in new payment obligations (1.92x multiplier).

Traditional lender: $70M loss - $18.2M recovery = $51.8M net loss.

BTC Now: Bitcoin reissuance reduces effective loss. Self-healing mechanism sustains warehouse capital through extreme default scenarios.

**Conservative design:** New asset class with no historical performance data. Base case assumes 8-15% defaults (industry-standard for FICO 670+ unsecured credit). Stress testing at 70% ensures bond structure protects AAA investors even in catastrophic scenarios—made possible by Bitcoin recovery advantage.

## Revenue Model

Two entities. Seven fee streams. 90%+ margins at scale.

### BTC Now (GP) Revenue

**Per $100M Tranche:**

**Upfront:**
- Loan origination: $1M (1% of $100M loans)
- Bond issuance: $2M (2% of $100M tranche structure, paid by warehouse)

**Recurring:**
- Loan servicing: $250K/year (0.25% annual on loans - covers custody fees and servicing operations)
- Bond servicing: $500K/year (0.5% annual on bonds, 10 years)

**Performance-based:**
- Carried interest: 50% of warehouse returns above 10% hurdle with high-water mark

**Warehouse-Level Fees (Total Fund, not per-tranche):**
- Warehouse management: $3M annually (2% of $150M warehouse AUM). Charged at fund level across all tranches—standard GP fund economics.

### Warehouse Fund Revenue

**Per $100M Tranche:**

**Recurring:**
- Spread capture: $7.56M annually (15% borrower APR - 7.44% weighted bond coupon). $75.6M per tranche over 10 years.
- Equity distributions: Retained $10M equity tranche per $100M bond issuance

**Profit split:**
- First 10% annual return: 100% to LPs
- Returns above 10%: Split 50/50 between warehouse LPs and BTC Now (GP)

### Revenue Trajectory

**BTC Now (GP) Revenue Only** (excludes warehouse fund spread capture and LP returns):

**Realistic scenario (Year 1 begins when first loans are issued in Q3-Q4 2026):**
- Year 1: **$10.5-18M** (2-4 new tranches; upfront + recurring + warehouse mgmt)
- Year 2: **$23.75-37M** (5-8 new tranches; upfront + recurring from all outstanding + warehouse mgmt + minimal carry)
- Year 3: **$39.75-59M** (8-12 new tranches; upfront + recurring from 15-24 outstanding + warehouse mgmt + carry ramping)
- Year 4+: **$53.75-68.5M** (10-12 new tranches annually; upfront + recurring from 25-36+ outstanding + warehouse mgmt + $2-2.5M carry at steady state)

**Revenue composition:**
- Upfront fees (origination + issuance): $3M per new tranche issued
- Recurring fees (loan + bond servicing): $750K/year per outstanding tranche over 10-year life
- Warehouse management: $3M annually (fund-level fee, not per-tranche)
- Carried interest: $0-2.5M annually (ramps as warehouse matures, steady state ~$2.5M)

**Note:** This trajectory reflects BTC Now GP management company revenue only. Does NOT include:
- Warehouse fund spread capture ($7.56M annually per tranche)
- LP preferred returns and profit distributions
- Equity tranche distributions

**Dual-path rating strategy:**
- **Path A (Years 1-2):** Package as unsecured consumer loans for faster rating access. Rating agencies understand this structure—can achieve ratings immediately or within 6 months.
- **Path B (Years 2-3):** Transition to Bitcoin-backed securities rating with 12-18 months of performance data. Higher rating potential showcasing Bitcoin recovery/reissuance advantage.

Conservative approach treats Bitcoin collateral as upside, not initial rating factor. Allows immediate rated market access while building proprietary performance dataset.

---

**Key Points:**

- **Capacity:** $150M warehouse supports 12 outstanding tranches as bonds ($12M capital impact per tranche: $10M equity locked in SPV + $2M issuance fee paid to GP). Total: $120M in equity tranches + $24M in fees across 12 tranches. Trajectory assumes sequential origination with capital recycling, accounting for demand generation and bond placement cycles.

- **Operating Expenses:** $2M annually initially (5 people, pre-loan issuance). Ramps to $4.3M annually once first loans issued (10 people, full marketing, travel). Profitable from first tranche—origination and servicing fees exceed operating costs at both phases.

- **10-Year Cumulative:** $400-550M BTC Now GP revenue. 90%+ operating margins at steady state.

---

## Capital Structure

Warehouse operates as GP/LP fund structure.

### BTC Now (GP)

Manages origination, underwriting, servicing, bond placement. Zero balance sheet exposure.

Earns:
- Management fees (2% annual on warehouse AUM)
- Origination fees (1% of loans)
- Servicing fees (0.25% annual on loans + 0.5% annual on bonds)
- Carried interest (50% of returns above 10% hurdle with high-water mark)

### Warehouse LPs

Warehouse operates as GP/LP fund structure (not debt or equity). LPs make capital commitments, receive preferred returns, and participate in profit splits above hurdle—standard private credit fund mechanics identical to Blackstone Credit, Apollo Funds, and KKR Private Credit.

**LP Economics:**

- **10% preferred return:** Guaranteed annual return to LPs
- **Compounding shortfall protection:** If warehouse returns fall below 10%, shortfall accumulates and compounds. LPs must receive all accumulated preferred return before GP earns any carry.
- **Example:** Year 1 returns 8% → LPs accrue 2% shortfall. Year 2 must pay 10% + 2% catchup (12.2% with compounding) before carry kicks in.
- **First LP special terms:** Receives 20% equity in BTC Now GP + preferred economics (locked in, no redemption rights)
- **Expected LP IRR:** 20-28%

**GP Carried Interest:**

- **Carry structure:** GP earns 50% of returns ABOVE 10% hurdle
- **High-water mark plus hurdle:** GP only earns carry on returns exceeding both the 10% hurdle AND previous peak performance—protects LPs from paying carry twice on recovery of prior losses
- **Example:** Returns dip then recover → GP doesn't earn carry on the recovery portion, only on new highs above prior peak

**Economic Example:** $150M generates $20M annually (13.3% gross):
- $15M preferred (10% hurdle) → 100% to LPs
- $5M excess → Split 50/50
- LPs receive: $17.5M (11.7% effective)
- GP receives: $2.5M carried interest

**Redemption Mechanics:**

- **First LP (20% BTC Now equity holder):** Locked in for life of fund, no redemption rights
- **Subsequent LPs:** May request redemption at any time (simple email request)
- **Redemption is at-will:** LP's decision to redeem, warehouse cannot force LPs out
- **Exiting LPs receive:** Original capital + all accumulated unpaid preferred return
- **During redemption period:** LPs continue earning returns until replacement capital secured
- **Warehouse commitment:** Will use best efforts to find replacement capital when redemption requested
- **No forced liquidation rights:** LPs cannot force warehouse to liquidate assets during market stress—protects operational continuity

**Closed-end fund structure:** Standard for private credit funds (Apollo, Blackstone, KKR all operate this way).

### Bond Structure

$70M AAA + $20M BBB sold to institutions. $10M equity retained by warehouse. $10M reserve pool funded from payments.

Bonds pay monthly interest + principal (amortizing structure, 10-year term).

**Payment waterfall (monthly):**
1. Collect borrower payments (15% effective APR)
2. Pay servicing fees (0.5% to BTC Now)
3. Pay AAA (7% coupon + principal)
4. Pay BBB (9% coupon + principal)
5. Replenish reserve pool to 10% of outstanding bond face value
6. Distribute excess spread to equity (held by warehouse)

Reserve pool builds from cash flows over time. Not upfront capital deployment.

Equity returns flow to warehouse fund. Creates capital recycling.

**Performance guarantee:** **Post-bond-issuance**, for first 12-24 months, warehouse swaps non-performing loans (>60 days delinquent) for performing loans with equal or better credit quality. Protects bond investors during extended loan seasoning period. Warehouse absorbs performance risk until loans demonstrate payment history.

**Two-phase seasoning:**
- Phase 1: 60-90 days pre-bond seasoning in warehouse
- Phase 2: 12-24 months post-bond with substitution guarantee
- Total: 15-27 months until loans are fully seasoned
- This extended guarantee is a competitive advantage for bond buyers

Self-healing warehouse sustains swap capacity: Swapped loans that default return as Bitcoin. Warehouse reissues Bitcoin as new performing loans. Swap capacity regenerates without depleting warehouse capital. Traditional lenders cannot offer sustainable swaps—each swap permanently consumes capital.

### Bitcoin Recovery & Reissuance

Self-healing warehouse mechanism.

Installment plans default during warehouse phase → Recover Bitcoin → Reissue in new installment plans → Generate fresh origination fee + new 10-year payment stream.

Traditional lending: Default → Liquidate at loss → Redeploy fresh capital.

BTC Now: Default → Recover Bitcoin → Reissue without new capital.

**Capital efficiency:**

$100M warehouse, 10% defaults = $10M defaulted. Bitcoin backing: $5.2M. Assume Bitcoin down 50%: Worth $2.6M.

Traditional lending: $10M loss - $2.6M recovery = $7.4M net loss. Deploy fresh $10M capital. Total impact: $17.4M.

BTC Now: Reissue $2.6M Bitcoin as new installment plans → generates $5M new obligations (1.92x multiplier). Effective loss: $5M. Fresh capital: $0. Total impact: $5M.

71% reduction in capital impact through reissuance.

Unique to commodity-backed lending. Traditional lenders cannot replicate.

### Current Status

No committed warehouse capital yet. Active negotiations with private lenders, Bitcoin whales, family offices.

$7M equity raise funds Bitcoin Conference live launch, warehouse LP roadshow, A+ product talent, and 18-month operating runway.

## What This $7M Achieves

This $7M seed round funds four critical milestones:

1. **Bitcoin Conference 2026 Launch Event** ($1M) — Main stage announcement April 27, 2026. Real loans funded Day 1. Bloomberg, Fox, CNBC coverage confirmed. 50K attendees, 250+ institutions on-site. Live origination creating institutional FOMO and warehouse LP pipeline.
2. **Warehouse LP Roadshow** ($1.5M) — Roadshow begins Q1 2026 to close $150M warehouse. Conference live origination creates leverage to close remaining commitments. First LP receives 20% BTC Now equity for warehouse commitment. Warehouse economics: 10% preferred return to LP, then 50/50 profit split above 10% hurdle with high-water mark protection.
3. **A+ Product/Design Talent** ($2M) — Platform is operational. This budget hires exceptional UI/UX talent to create world-class user experience beyond functional minimum. Design that converts.
4. **Operating Runway + Scale** ($2.5M) — 18 months runway to $100M+ origination volume, including team salaries, legal/compliance ($500-750K), custody integration ($500K complete Nov 2025), GP/LP structure ($250K complete Dec 2025), security hardening and team expansion.

**Timeline:** Custody complete November 2025. GP/LP structure December 2025. Warehouse roadshow begins Q1 2026. April 27, 2026 launch. $150M warehouse closed Q2 2026. First securitization Q3 2026.

**Current stage:** Pre-revenue. Platform operational. No committed warehouse capital yet. Active partnership negotiations.

**Capital deployment strategy:** Unspent raise capital (minus 6-month operating runway) deployed into warehouse alongside LP commitments for launch origination. Contingency: If no LP commitments by April 2026, founders provide $5M warehouse capital for launch origination.

$7M raise at $40M post-money reflects pre-revenue risk. Conference proof-of-concept changes valuation overnight.

### Execution Milestones

**Lender-of-record partnership:**

Status: Negotiations with Cross River, WebBank. Preliminary discussions underway.

**Why we need lender-of-record:** This is not just payment processing. Lender-of-record partners provide account management infrastructure that's critical for our installment purchase structure. Each Bitcoin installment gets its own account at the lender-of-record. This infrastructure is especially valuable when transferring loans to Bond SPVs: the consumer continues paying the same account number, while the lender-of-record seamlessly changes account ownership from warehouse to SPV behind the scenes. This operational infrastructure makes the installment purchase structure work smoothly at scale.

Budget: $2M for legal structuring, compliance integration, partnership finalization.

Timeline: Q4 2025 - Q1 2026 (6-9 months).

Fallback: Multiple regional banks offer lender-of-record services.

**$150M warehouse facility:**

Status: We've had exploratory conversations with family offices and Bitcoin whales in our network. Formal commitments are contingent on beta traction and demand validation—this is expected and appropriate at seed stage.

Leverage: This $7M raise provides leverage for warehouse negotiations by demonstrating beta performance data and signup momentum. First LP economics (20% BTC Now equity + 10% preferred + 50% carry above hurdle) designed to attract capital once proof of concept established.

Budget: $2.1M for roadshow, term sheet negotiations, legal documentation.

Timeline: Q1-Q2 2026 (post-beta launch).

**Custody partnerships:**

Status: Custody is a commodity service. Coinbase Custody, Anchorage Digital, and BitGo all offer standard institutional custody at ~0.25% AUM with established pricing and service terms.

We'll execute standard service agreements during Q4 2025 technical buildout. No partnership risk—this is infrastructure procurement with established pricing, similar to opening a bank account. Standard API documentation, insurance arrangements, and technical integration.

**Custody fee economics:** Pre-bond, custody fees are warehouse operating expenses. Post-bond, custody fees (0.25% AUM) are paid from loan servicing revenue (0.25% annual on loans = $250K/year per tranche), not deducted from bond investor spread.

Budget: $500K for API integration, insurance arrangements, technical implementation.

Timeline: Q4 2025 - Q1 2026.

### Regulatory

**Legal counsel:** Stinson (engaged).

**Structure:** Installment purchase plan, NOT consumer lending.

**Key differentiation:** Warehouse maintains Bitcoin inventory. We sell Bitcoin we own, not facilitate purchases on demand. This distinguishes us from consumer lending classification and associated 50-state licensing requirements.

**Note on terminology:** This document uses "loans" and "lending" for investor clarity, as these terms are widely understood in capital markets. However, the legal structure is an installment purchase of Bitcoin inventory we own. This distinction is critical for regulatory classification—we are selling a commodity with installment payment terms, not engaging in consumer lending.

Structuring as commodity purchase with installment payment terms avoids:
- Consumer lending licenses (50 states)
- TILA/FCRA consumer protection complexity
- Interest rate caps and usury laws

Lender-of-record partnership provides banking infrastructure and regulatory umbrella for payment processing and custody arrangements.

Budget: $1.5M for legal/compliance. Entity formation, lender-of-record partnership, SEC review, custody agreements, BSA/AML development, state compliance verification.

### Execution

Q1 2026 beta launch depends on this $7M raise.

**Beta platform status: 95% complete.**

**Already operational:**
- AML/KYC systems (fully built and tested)
- Credit check infrastructure (integrated with major bureaus)
- Underwriting system (risk models and approval workflows)
- Borrower portal (user interface and account management)

**Pending completion:**
- Custody integration (Coinbase Custody/Anchorage Digital API integration)
- Lender-of-record banking infrastructure (account management system integration)

**Timeline:** Q1 2026 completion depends on custody and lender-of-record partnerships (covered by $1.4M beta budget). Core platform is built—final integration work only.

This dramatically de-risks execution. We're not building from scratch; we're connecting to established infrastructure providers.

**Demand validation:**

Network validation through extensive conversations within Bitcoin holder networks shows strong appetite: $2-5K/month installment plans preferred over traditional leverage options (HELOCs requiring home equity, personal loans with investment covenants, margin loans with liquidation risk).

Macro validation: Global Bitcoin ETF adoption (BlackRock iShares, Fidelity) and corporate treasury adoption (MicroStrategy, Tesla) prove institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as asset class. This creates downstream consumer demand for Bitcoin access products.

Market timing: Either seed investors believe Bitcoin adoption trajectory creates demand for non-liquidatable credit access, or they miss the opportunity.

**Launch strategy:** Bitcoin Conference 2026 (April 27, Las Vegas, 50,000+ attendees) provides concentrated launch audience of high-intent Bitcoin buyers.

**Beta validates critical assumptions:**
- Pricing acceptance (15% effective APR for 10 years?)
- Loan size preference ($25K? $50K? $75K?)
- Bond investor appetite (unrated Bitcoin-backed bonds?)

**If validation fails:** Pivot pricing, pivot product, or return remaining capital.

**Transparency:** You invest BEFORE formal demand validation. Higher risk compensated through entry valuation ($40M post-money).

## The Ask

$7M equity raise at $40M post-money. 17.5% dilution. Preferred equity.

**Note to seed investors:** First warehouse LP will receive 20% equity in BTC Now GP as part of warehouse facility terms. This dilution is acceptable as warehouse facility is prerequisite for operations.

### Use of Funds

**$1.5M — Legal & Compliance**

Lender-of-record partnership, SEC review (required for bond rating process Years 2-3 transition from unrated to rated bonds—proactive budget allocation to avoid delays when approaching rating agencies), custody agreements, entity formation, BSA/AML development, state compliance.

**$2.1M — Warehouse Facility Roadshow**

Institutional presentations, term sheet negotiations, legal documentation for $150M warehouse commitment. First LP receives 20% BTC Now equity + preferred economics.

**$1.4M — Beta Platform Launch**

Q1 2026 market entry. Technology development, underwriting system, custody integration, borrower portal, loan servicing infrastructure.

**$2.0M — Operating Runway**

6-9 months operating runway (total budget for period, not annualized rate).

**Team structure (10 positions total):**
1. CEO - Marc Dumpff
2. Chief Risk Officer - Evan Kalimtzis
3. Chief Product Officer - Alexander Watanabe
4. CTO - Korneliusz Caputa
5. COO - James Alder
6. Chief Loan Officer - Peter Howard (finalizing)
7. Warehouse President - TBD (post-warehouse close)
8. Chief Marketing Officer - TBD (post-beta launch)
9. Chief Legal Officer - TBD (post-beta launch)
10. Chief Financial Officer - TBD (post-beta launch)

All positions: $20K/month + performance bonuses.

**Phased hiring:**
- Immediate: 5 positions (founding team)
- Post-first-loan: Chief Loan Officer, Warehouse President, CMO
- Post-beta: Chief Legal, CFO

**Operating expenses at full capacity:**
- Salaries: $2.4M/year (10 people × $20K/month)
- Travel/roadshow: $1M/year
- Marketing (post-beta): $500K/year
- Software & operations: $400K/year
- Total: $4.3M/year at scale

$2M operating runway covers 6-9 months with phased hiring, allowing team to achieve warehouse commitment and beta launch milestones.

**Note:** Initial annual operating rate ~$2.7M/year (extrapolated from 9-month budget), ramping to $4.3M/year at full scale post-loan issuance.

Capital deploys over 6-9 months. Achieves warehouse commitment. Launches loan origination.

### Leverage Path

$7M equity → $150M warehouse secured → $1.2B bond origination capacity.

8x leverage on warehouse capital ($1.2B bonds / $150M warehouse capital). The $1.2B in bonds is backed by $150M warehouse capital + $120M in equity tranches locked in SPVs (12 tranches × $10M each) + $7M seed equity funding GP operations.

**Capital efficiency story:** $7M seed equity enables access to $150M warehouse facility, which generates $1.2B in bond origination capacity through sequential deployment and capital recycling.

Sequencing:
1. Raise $7M equity (this round)
2. Launch beta (Q1 2026) → Generate signup data
3. Use signup data as leverage → Secure $150M warehouse (Q2-Q3 2026)
4. Originate and season loans → First issuance Q3-Q4 2026
5. Approach bond buyers → With real performance data

This round unlocks warehouse. Warehouse unlocks origination. Origination unlocks securitization. Securitization unlocks scale.

### Exit Strategy

Exit multiple: Target 8-12x revenue (fintech infrastructure exits serving institutional markets).

**Strategic buyer value:**
- BBS cashflows: 10-year duration bonds, predictable income
- Risk models: Proprietary, competitive moat
- Loan performance data: First-mover dataset for Bitcoin credit
- Platform infrastructure: Licensable as BBS-as-a-Service

**Potential acquirers:**
- Financial institutions (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon)
- Fintech platforms (PayPal, Block, Coinbase)
- Credit funds (Apollo, KKR, Blackstone)

**Historical precedent:**
- **GreenSky:** Point-of-sale lending platform, acquired by Goldman Sachs for $2.2B
- **SoFi:** Securitization + lending platform, $8.65B valuation at SPAC
- **Upstart:** AI lending + securitization, peaked at $12B+ market cap
- **Figure:** Blockchain-based lending with securitization, $3.2B valuation
- **Avant:** Consumer credit platform, $2B valuation

Fintech lending platforms with securitization achieve 8-12x revenue multiples, especially with proprietary data advantages.

If we achieve $50-100M revenue (Years 3-5), **$400M-$1.2B** exit range credible. Premium multiple justified by: proprietary Bitcoin credit performance data, self-healing warehouse mechanics (unique to commodity-backed lending), and proven securitization track record.

Alternative: High-margin business supports dividend distributions. Company can remain private, distribute cashflows indefinitely.

Minimum dilution expected going forward. $150M warehouse supports 12 outstanding tranches as bonds ($120M in equity tranches locked + $24M in fees). Revenue from first tranches funds operations indefinitely.

## Financial Projections

### Base Case

**BTC Now (GP) Revenue Only** (excludes warehouse fund spread capture and LP returns):

Year 1 begins when first loans are issued (Q3-Q4 2026):

- Year 1: **$10.5-18M** (2-4 new tranches; upfront + recurring + warehouse mgmt)
- Year 2: **$23.75-37M** (5-8 new tranches; upfront + recurring from all outstanding + warehouse mgmt + minimal carry)
- Year 3: **$39.75-59M** (8-12 new tranches; upfront + recurring from 15-24 outstanding + warehouse mgmt + carry ramping)
- Year 4+: **$53.75-68.5M** (10-12 new tranches annually; upfront + recurring from 25-36+ outstanding + warehouse mgmt + $2-2.5M carry at steady state)

10-year cumulative: $400-550M revenue. 90%+ operating margins at steady state.

**Note:** This trajectory reflects BTC Now GP management company revenue only. Does NOT include:
- Warehouse fund spread capture ($7.56M annually per tranche)
- LP preferred returns and profit distributions
- Equity tranche distributions

Operating expenses: $2M annually initially (5 people, pre-loan issuance). Ramps to $4.3M annually once first loans issued (10 people, full marketing, travel). Profitable from first tranche. No path-to-profitability risk.

### Stress Testing

Survives 90% Bitcoin crash + 70% lifetime defaults.

10M Monte Carlo simulations across 432 scenarios.

**Bond structure resilience:**

Bitcoin recovery advantage: Unlike traditional ABS where repossessed collateral depreciates 20-40%, Bitcoin can always be recovered at market value and reissued. This self-healing mechanism makes the structure dramatically more resilient than traditional consumer lending.

AAA tranche remains fully protected through 70% lifetime defaults—even with a 90% Bitcoin price crash factored in. This protection level is possible because we can recover and reissue defaulted Bitcoin at market value, generating fresh revenue without new capital.

Business survives extreme stress scenarios with AAA protection intact.

Conservative design for new asset class with no historical performance data.

**Full stress test models available to investors:** Monte Carlo simulations, jump diffusion models, custom scenario testing. Investors can run sensitivity analyses on default rates, Bitcoin volatility, and prepayment assumptions.

Self-sustaining after first tranche sale. Origination fees + servicing fees cover operating expenses. Each subsequent tranche adds to cumulative revenue without increasing fixed costs.

### Long-Term Economics

Year 5+: Origination + servicing on 30+ cumulative tranches + equity spread capture from seasoned bonds.

Year 10+: Origination + servicing on 60+ cumulative tranches + full spread potential from mature portfolio.

Equity tranche returns: Bonds issued in Year 1 return equity distributions for 10 years. By Year 5, warehouse receives equity distributions from 20+ bonds simultaneously.

Self-healing warehouse: Recovered Bitcoin generates incremental origination fees without new capital. Reduces effective LGD vs. traditional consumer lending (25-40% from non-depreciating collateral alone, 50-70% including all three protection layers). Reduces dependency on fresh LP capital for growth.
