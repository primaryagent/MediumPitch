## HOW WE COMMUNICATE

### Core Principles

1. **Direct** - Say what it is. No preamble. No setup.
2. **Factual** - Numbers speak. Adjectives don't.
3. **Non-apologetic** - We don't hedge. We don't soften. We state.
4. **Methodical** - Structured like code. Precise like engineering.
5. **To the point** - One concept per sentence. No more.

### Voice Characteristics

**We write like engineers, not marketers.**
- Show the math
- State the structure
- Define the mechanism
- Let the innovation speak for itself

**We sound like:**
- A term sheet
- A system architecture document
- A financial model
- A founder who's done the work

**We don't sound like:**
- A sales pitch
- A thought leadership piece
- A press release
- A consultant's deck

## THE RULES

### DO

- "Banks gain Bitcoin exposure" not "Bitcoin exposure is provided"

✓ **State facts**
- "The only way to buy Bitcoin on leverage without a margin call"

### The One-Sentence Test

Before writing anything, ask:
1. Can I replace an adjective with a number?
2. Can I remove a qualifier and the statement still be true?
3. Would an engineer write it this way?
4. Does it sound like a term sheet or a sales pitch?

If it sounds like a sales pitch, rewrite it.

**Adapt (but keep principles) for:**
- Legal documents (add required qualifiers)

## FINAL RULE

If you're about to write something and you think "Is this too direct?" or "Should I soften this?"

The answer is: No. Say it.

We're not here to hedge. We're here to build Bitcoin credit.

**Bitcoin Now Bankable.**
