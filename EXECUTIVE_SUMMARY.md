## What We Do

**The Product:** Consumer wants to buy $50K of Bitcoin but doesn't have $50K cash. We finance the purchase: they receive $50K of Bitcoin immediately (held in institutional custody with transfer restrictions), make fixed monthly payments over 10 years at 15% APR, and own it outright after final payment. No margin calls if Bitcoin crashesâ€”fixed dollar payments regardless of Bitcoin price. No forced liquidations.

**Why this matters:** Americans can't get long-term credit for Bitcoin purchases. Personal loans prohibit investment use. Credit cards charge 25%+ and tank credit scores. Margin loans force liquidations during crashes (May 2021: 50% drop, mass liquidations). We're the only non-liquidatable Bitcoin financing option.

**The Business Model:** We originate $100M of these Bitcoin installment plans, then package them into bonds (Bitcoin-Backed Securities). AAA/BBB tranches pay 7-9% coupons to institutional investors. We capture $7.56M annual spread per tranche (15% borrower APR minus bond coupons minus servicing). First securitized Bitcoin credit product. Banks cannot compete under Basel III (1250% risk weight on Bitcoin exposures).

## Market Opportunity

$2.2T Bitcoin market cap. $0 institutional credit access without liquidation risk.

Potential credit market: $440-550B (20-25% of Bitcoin market cap, matching real estate/auto leverage ratios).

Target market: 36-45M Americans with FICO 670+ who own crypto. 5% penetration at $40K average = $72-90B addressable.

We are price makers, not price takers. Zero competition for this structure.

## Traction & Status

- **Warehouse discussions:** Family offices, Bitcoin whales. Q1 2026 roadshow, $150M target close Q2 2026

## The Ask

**Raising:** $7M at $40M post (17.5%)

**Use of Funds:**
- $1M: Bitcoin Conference launch (main stage, live origination)
- $1.5M: Warehouse LP roadshow ($150M target)
- $1M: A+ product/design talent
- $1M: State licensing (50 states)
- $2.5M: Operating runway (18 months to $100M+ originations)

**Leverage path:** $7M â†’ $150M warehouse â†’ $1.2B bond capacity

**We launch April 2026 with or without VC funding.**

Question: Seed pricing at $40M post now, or Series A pricing after we prove demand?
