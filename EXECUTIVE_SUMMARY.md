## What We Do

We offer Bitcoin installment plans with pricing equivalent to 15% effective APR over 10-year terms and zero margin call risk. Borrowers own their Bitcoin from day one, held in institutional custody (Fireblocks Trust, 4 bps annual fee) with transfer restrictions until final payment. Monthly payments remain fixed regardless of Bitcoin's price. No forced liquidations, ever.

We securitize $100M face value Bitcoin installment plans into Bitcoin-Backed Securities (BBS). AAA tranche pays 7% coupon, BBB tranche pays 9% coupon. Each tranche generates $7.56M annual spread ($75.6M over 10 years). This is the first securitized Bitcoin installment credit product delivering fixed interest to institutional bond investors.

Our bankruptcy-remote structure keeps Bitcoin off our balance sheet entirely, eliminating corporate risk. Bonds are backed by non-depreciating collateral with a self-healing recovery mechanism that regenerates performing assets instead of depleting capital.

## Market Opportunity

**$2.2T Bitcoin market cap. $0 institutional credit access without liquidation risk.**

Potential credit market: **$440-550B** (20-25% of market cap, matching traditional asset leverage ratios). Real estate: 23% leverage. Autos: 25% leverage. Bitcoin: 0% leverage.

**Target market:** 36-45M Americans with FICO 670+ scores who own cryptocurrency. Average credit capacity: $30-50K per consumer. 5% penetration at $40K average = **$72-90B addressable market**.

**Why existing credit fails Bitcoin buyers:**
- **Personal loans:** Prohibit investment use (covenant violations trigger full repayment). 3-5 year terms (never 10+ years).
- **HELOCs:** Require 20% home equity that high-income earners ($100K-$175K salaries, FICO 720+) haven't accumulated yet.
- **Credit cards:** Carrying $50K balance for 10 years tanks FICO by 100+ points.
- **Margin loans:** Force liquidations during crashes (May 2021's 50% drop in 72 hours triggered mass liquidations).

We are price makers, not price takers. Zero competition exists for this structure. 15% effective APR reflects lender risk while providing the only non-liquidatable Bitcoin credit option in market.

## Business Model & Unit Economics

**Two entities:** BTC Now GP (management company) + $150M Warehouse Fund (GP/LP structure)

**Seven revenue streams:**

1. **Loan origination:** $1M per tranche (1% of $100M loans)
2. **Bond issuance:** $2M per tranche (2% of $100M structure)
3. **Loan servicing:** $250K/year per tranche (0.25% annual)
4. **Bond servicing:** $500K/year per tranche (0.5% annual, 10 years)
5. **Warehouse management:** $3M/year (2% of $150M AUM)
6. **Spread capture:** $7.56M/year per tranche (borrower 15% APR - bond 7.44% coupon - 0.75% servicing)
7. **Carried interest:** 50% of returns above 10% hurdle

**Capital leverage:** $150M warehouse → $1.2B bond origination capacity (12 tranches over time through sequential deployment and capital recycling)

**GP Revenue trajectory (BTC Now management company only, excludes warehouse returns):**
- **Year 1:** $10.5-18M (2-4 new tranches + recurring + warehouse mgmt)
- **Year 2:** $23.75-37M (5-8 new tranches + all outstanding recurring + minimal carry)
- **Year 3:** $39.75-59M (8-12 new tranches + 15-24 outstanding + carry ramping)
- **Year 4+:** $53.75-68.5M (10-12 new annually + 25-36+ outstanding + steady carry)

**Operating margins:** 90%+ at scale. Profitable from first tranche (origination + servicing fees exceed operating costs).

**Warehouse LP economics:** 10% preferred return, then 50/50 profit split above hurdle. Expected LP IRR: 20-28%. At steady state (12 tranches generating $90.72M gross annually): LPs receive $52.86M (35.24% effective return), BTC Now receives $37.86M carried interest.

## The Moat

**Permanent regulatory moat:** Basel III imposes 1250% risk weight on Bitcoin exposures. For every $1 of Bitcoin-backed lending, banks must hold $1.25 in Tier 1 capital. A $100M Bitcoin loan portfolio requires banks to hold $125M in regulatory capital—more capital than the loan itself. At typical 15% ROE hurdles, banks need $18.75M annual profit. Our 15% APR generates $15M annually on $100M—not enough to cover their cost of capital. **Banks cannot profitably offer this product under current regulations.**

Our warehouse is funded by private LPs, not bank deposits. Zero Basel III capital requirements. Bitcoin held off-balance-sheet in bankruptcy-remote structure. This regulatory advantage requires international coordination across 28 jurisdictions to change (5-10 year timeline minimum).

**Self-healing warehouse:** Defaults regenerate performing assets instead of depleting capital. Three-layer advantage: (1) Retained payments before default stay with warehouse, (2) Bitcoin recovered at market value (not depreciated like cars/homes), (3) Reissued as new installment plans generating fresh origination fees and 10-year payment streams without fresh capital. Result: 50-70% LGD reduction vs. traditional consumer lending. Defaults that occur after 3+ years can be economically neutral or accretive to warehouse.

**First-mover advantage:** 12-18 months proprietary loan performance data. Rating agency relationships. Proven bond placement track record. Each loan adds to proprietary performance dataset competitors cannot replicate.

**Capital efficiency:** Profitable at $100M originations vs. banks needing $500M-$1B to justify overhead. Goldman Sachs rationally chooses to buy our bonds at 8% rather than build origination infrastructure for sub-$200M volumes.

Competitors need all pieces simultaneously: non-depreciating collateral (Bitcoin), installment purchase structure (not margin loans), institutional custody integration, continuous reissuance systems.

## Traction & Status

**Platform operational:**
- 5-minute KYC/credit approvals
- Stripe payment rails (ACH, card, crypto)
- Custody integration: Fireblocks Trust, 4 bps annual fee (vs 20-25 bps institutional standard), complete December 2025
- Legal structure: Confirmed by Stinson (commodity installment plan avoids 50-state consumer lending licenses)

**Built entirely with founder capital:** $1.5M deployed (no outside capital yet), $1.5M additional founder commitment in reserve.

**Launch:** April 27, 2026 (Bitcoin Conference, Las Vegas). 50,000+ attendees, concentrated audience of high-intent Bitcoin buyers. Main stage announcement with Bloomberg, Fox, CNBC coverage confirmed. Live origination Day 1—real loans funded, real Bitcoin delivered. Not a demo.

**Warehouse discussions:** Preliminary conversations underway with family offices and Bitcoin whales. Roadshow begins Q1 2026 targeting $150M close Q2 2026. Conference live origination creates leverage to close remaining commitments.

## The Ask

**Raising:** $7M equity at $40M post-money (17.5% dilution, preferred equity)

**Use of Funds:**
- **$1M:** Bitcoin Conference 2026 launch event (main stage, media coverage, live origination creating institutional FOMO)
- **$1.5M:** Warehouse LP roadshow ($150M target close Q2 2026)
- **$1M:** A+ product/design talent (world-class UX beyond functional minimum)
- **$1M:** State licensing (all 50 states within 6 months—front-running regulatory challenges)
- **$2.5M:** Operating runway + scale (18 months to $100M+ origination volume)

**Leverage path:** $7M seed equity → $150M warehouse → $1.2B bond origination capacity. 8x leverage through sequential deployment and capital recycling.

**First LP terms:** Receives 20% BTC Now equity for $150M warehouse commitment. 10% preferred return, 50/50 profit split above hurdle, high-water mark protection.

**Note to seed investors:** First warehouse LP receives 20% equity as part of warehouse facility terms. This dilution is acceptable as warehouse facility is prerequisite for operations.

**We launch April 2026 with or without venture capital.** Question: Do you want seed-stage pricing at $40M post, or Series A pricing after we prove demand?

## Risk Mitigation

**Stress test:** Structure survives 70% lifetime defaults + 90% Bitcoin crash. AAA tranche fully protected through extreme scenarios.

**Conservative design:** New asset class with no historical performance data. Base case assumes 8-15% defaults (industry-standard for FICO 670+ unsecured credit). Stress testing at 70% ensures bond structure protects AAA investors even in catastrophic scenarios.

**10M Monte Carlo simulations** across 432 scenarios (default rates, Bitcoin volatility, prepayment assumptions). Self-healing warehouse mechanics reduce dependency on perfect credit performance. Bitcoin recovery and reissuance advantage makes structure dramatically more resilient than traditional consumer lending.

Full stress test models available to investors for custom scenario testing.

## Exit Strategy

**Target:** 8-12x revenue multiples (fintech infrastructure exits serving institutional markets)

**Strategic buyer value:**
- BBS cashflows (10-year duration bonds, predictable income)
- Proprietary risk models (competitive moat)
- Loan performance data (first-mover dataset for Bitcoin credit)
- Platform infrastructure (licensable as BBS-as-a-Service)

**Potential acquirers:** JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon (traditional finance seeking Bitcoin exposure), Coinbase, Block, Kraken (crypto-native seeking credit products), PayPal/Venmo (fintech needing Bitcoin offerings)

**Comparable exits:** LendingClub ($9B SPAC), SoFi ($8.65B SPAC), Figure ($3.2B valuation), Upstart ($12B+ peak market cap), Avant ($2B valuation)

**If we achieve $50-100M revenue (Years 3-5), $400M-$1.2B exit range credible.** Premium multiple justified by proprietary Bitcoin credit performance data, self-healing warehouse mechanics (unique to commodity-backed lending), and proven securitization track record.

**Alternative:** High-margin business supports dividend distributions. Company can remain private, distribute cashflows indefinitely. Minimum dilution expected going forward—revenue from first tranches funds operations.
